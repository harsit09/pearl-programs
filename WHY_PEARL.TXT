WHY ?

While Perl may not be as widely used or popular as some other programming languages in today's digital era, it still holds relevance in certain domains and has a dedicated community of users. Here are a few reasons why Perl remains relevant:

1. Legacy Systems: Perl has been around for decades and is often found in legacy systems. Many organizations still maintain and update Perl codebases, making knowledge of Perl valuable for maintaining and enhancing existing systems.

2. System Administration and DevOps: Perl's text processing capabilities, regular expression support, and ease of integration with system utilities make it suitable for system administration tasks and scripting automation. It is often used in areas such as log analysis, network programming, and server-side scripting.

3. Web Development: Perl's CGI module paved the way for dynamic web applications, and Perl-based frameworks like Mojolicious continue to be used for web development. While other languages like Python and JavaScript dominate this space, Perl's web development frameworks and libraries still find application in certain contexts.

4. Bioinformatics: Perl has been widely adopted in the field of bioinformatics due to its powerful text processing capabilities and extensive libraries for genomic data analysis. Many bioinformatics tools and resources are written in Perl, making knowledge of the language essential for bioinformatics researchers.

5. System Tools and Scripting: Perl's concise syntax, powerful regular expressions, and extensive library ecosystem make it an excellent choice for writing system tools and automation scripts. It is often used for tasks such as file manipulation, data extraction, and report generation.

6. Text Processing and Parsing: Perl's heritage as a text-processing language still makes it relevant today. Its rich set of regular expression features and built-in text processing functions make it well-suited for parsing and manipulating textual data.

While Perl's popularity may have declined in certain areas, it still serves as a reliable tool in specific domains and continues to be actively maintained and updated. As with any programming language, its relevance ultimately depends on the specific use case and the preferences of developers and organizations.
